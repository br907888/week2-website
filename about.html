                        <h2 style="text-align: left;">A Fusion of Two Worlds</h2>
                        <p>Every Witch Way was born from a simple observation: why should you have to choose between an exceptional bakery and an outstanding coffee shop? In 2018, we set out to create a space where artisan baking and craft coffee coexist in perfect harmony.</p>
                        <p>Our founders, lifelong friends who met in culinary school, shared a vision of creating the ultimate neighborhood hangout. One was a pastry chef trained in Paris, the other a coffee roaster who had traveled the world studying brewing techniques. Together, they created Every Witch Way.</p>
                        <p>The name came from our belief that there's magic in bringing people together over great food and drink. We wanted a space that felt like a warm hug on a crisp autumn day, where the stress of daily life melts away the moment you walk through our doors.</p>
                        <p>What started as a small corner shop in downtown Orlando has grown into a beloved Central Florida institution, but our commitment to quality and community remains unchanged.</p>
