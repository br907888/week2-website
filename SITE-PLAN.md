# Every Witch Way - Site Plan
## Business Overview

Every Witch Way is a bakery in dowtown Orlando that offers high quality baked goods and coffee-based beverages, from lattes, mochas and more. The bakery is themed with a cozy, autumnal/Halloween atmosphere that evokes a the feeling of the shop around the corner. The main motif is that of witches, but more of a cute, cozy vibe. Every Witch Way also offers an atomsphere for students to study while enjoying their food.

**Target Audience** College students (18-26), who are looking for a place to relax and study during the week, but find other spots not as personable or inviting.

**Brand Personality** Warm, comfroting, inviting, putting great care into the services provided to customers. Again, very "shop around the corner", charming in its approach.
